### issue 
1) binary trees take up to much space 
// from parent point e
   // draw a line down 
   // rotate it to the by -70 & 70 deg.
   // for left nodes subtract nodesize from x

### Space
To create extra space the root node has a degree of x
all children have x-y, those childen are x-2y etc.
the length of line from one node to another follows a similar shrinking pattern.
as does the node size.
